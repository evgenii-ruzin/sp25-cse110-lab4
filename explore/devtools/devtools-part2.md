1. the bug was that the program was interpreting num1 and num2 as strings, so instead of adding numbers it was concatenating strings
2. to fix the bug, the program needed to make sure that num1 and num2 are treated as numbers. To do this, I initialized both num1 and num2 to be (value of the box * 1), so they will be treated as numbers
